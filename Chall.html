<h2 id="Link1">Security</h2>
<p > IoT presents a peculiar security challenge because of the massive number of connected devices that expand the attack vector and secondly because of the computation and memory constraint that makes it impossible to install an elaborate security software in the devices. To overcome this challenge innovative security approaches are being developed and deployed. Some of the IoT security tools in use are Zero Trust, hardware security, etc. </p>


<h2 id="Link2">Privacy</h2>
<p>Massive data is collected and processed with IoT. These data is either personal or societal/national. Thus how personal data is used raises important privacy questions. So countries have introduced data protection rules to protect their citizens. The GDPR inacted by EU is a case in point. However, this issue is controversial and still deliberation on how to come up with the best privacy protection without stifling innovation is an open question.</p>
<p> </p>

<h2 id="Link3">Safety</h2>
<p>It is important to make sure that software operation in IoT is error free espeially in devices that can put life in hazard. Medical devices, autonomous vehicles, and such devices closely related to human life should be safe or fault proof. The safety of mission critical applications is also important even if it does not involve hazard to humans due to the huge loss they incur </p>

<P>A closing Qoute</p>
<p>Internet of Things is transforming the everyday physical objects that surround us into an ecosystem of information that will enrich our lives. From refrigerators to parking spaces to houses, the Internet of Things is bringing more and more things into the digital fold every day, which will likely make the Internet of Things a multi-trillion dollar industry in the near future. </p><p>PricewaterhouseCoopers report</p>
